                        My name is Cheddi Charles. I am the oldest of five brothers. I was born from the beautiful island of 
                        Grenada located south of the Caribbean sea. Growing up was not easy because we have to work hard to get what you want.

                    <P >
                        Sports is one of my favorite hobbies. I play cricket, soccer and basketball whenever I get the chance. I always 
                        dream of playing for my country but I was not good enough. At a young age, I had a liking for numbers and maths becasue 
                        i was never really at English and writing even up today. I used my math skills  to help me solve problems and 
                        went on to do my first degree in mathematics.
                    </P>

                        Currently I am a high school math teacher. Outside of work , I like going out to the movies, road trips, 
                        and out door activities.
